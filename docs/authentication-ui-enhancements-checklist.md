## UI Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test all forms in both English and Arabic
- [ ] Verify RTL layout works correctly in Arabic
- [ ] Test all forms on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- [ ] Verify all forms work in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Test form validation and error messages
- [ ] Verify loading states display correctly
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation and tab order
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Verify all translations are correct and complete

## Functional Testing Status

- [x] UI enhancements implemented for all authentication components
- [x] React-icons package installed and integrated
- [x] Forgot password functionality tested and working
- [x] Reset password email delivery confirmed
- [x] Login functionality fixed (resolved issue with password comparison after reset)
- [ ] Registration functionality needs verification
- [ ] OTP verification flow needs end-to-end testing
- [ ] Admin login needs verification

## Known Issues and Next Steps

1. **Login Functionality**: Fixed. The issue was due to a mismatch between password hashing methods in the reset and login flows.
   - Resolution: Updated the `comparePassword` function in `password-validation.ts` to use the proper `comparePasswords` function from `crypto.ts`.

2. **Package Dependencies**: 
   - Added react-icons package to support the enhanced UI components.
   - Need to ensure all dependencies are properly documented in package.json.

3. **Production Testing**:
   - All UI enhancements need to be tested in production mode using `npm run test:prod`.
   - Verify that authentication flows work correctly in the production build.

4. **Documentation**:
   - This checklist has been updated to reflect the current status.
   - API documentation may need updates to reflect any changes to authentication endpoints.
