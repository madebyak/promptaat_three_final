Based on my analysis of the documentation, I'll present a comprehensive plan for implementing the authentication and user management system. Here's the proposed plan:
Phase 1: Core Authentication System
1. Database Updates
    * Add new fields to Users table:
        * profile_image_url
        * email_verified
        * google_id
        * verification_token
        * reset_password_token
        * reset_password_expires
2. Authentication Components  CopyInsert src/components/auth/
3. ├── sign-in-form.tsx
4. ├── sign-up-form.tsx
5. ├── otp-verification.tsx
6. ├── forgot-password.tsx
7. ├── reset-password.tsx
8. ├── google-auth-button.tsx
9. └── auth-layout.tsx   
10. Authentication Pages  CopyInsert src/app/[locale]/auth/
11. ├── sign-in/page.tsx
12. ├── sign-up/page.tsx
13. ├── verify-email/page.tsx
14. ├── forgot-password/page.tsx

Phase 4: State Management & Hooks

typescript
CopyInsert
// src/hooks/use-auth.ts
export const useAuth = () => {
  const user = ...
  const login = ...
  const logout = ...
  const register = ...
  return { user, login, logout, register }
}

// src/providers/auth-provider.tsx

    * Email verification system
    * Password hashing and security
    * JWT implementation
2. Week 2: OAuth & Password Recovery
    * Google OAuth integration
    * Forgot password flow
    * Email templates
    * OTP system
3. Week 3: User Profile
    * Profile management
    * Avatar upload
    * Settings page
    * Account deletion
4. Week 4: User Collections
    * Bookmarks system
    * Catalogs management
    * User history
    * Data persistence
Technical Specifications:
1. Authentication Flow
    * JWT for session management

    * CSRF protection
    * Rate limiting
2. Storage
    * Profile images: Cloud storage (S3/Cloudinary)
    * Secure file upload
    * Image optimization
3. Security Measures
    * Password strength requirements

Me

i have few questions before i give you the approval i need you to clarify
1. if the user signed up or logged in with google gmail account, what data can we have in the future in our admin panel / user page ?
2. is this approach doable for users who register with their email address and user register with gmail 
3. what do you need from me regarding the google verification as inforamtion or keys or tokens?
4. in the classic register with email we will request from the user First Name - Last Name - Email - Password - Country , how are we going to ensure users who register with their gmail to provide the same informations ? 

do you have any questions for me or confusing stuff that need to be clarified ? 

Let me address each of your questions:
1. Google Sign-in Data Available:
    * Email address (verified by Google)
    * Full name (first and last)
    * Profile picture URL
    * Google Account ID (unique identifier)
    * Optional data (if we request additional scopes):
        * Language preference
        * Time zone
        * Public profile information
2. All this data will be visible in:
    * Admin Panel: Full user details including sign-up method
    * User Profile: User can see and edit their information
3. Unified Approach for Both Methods: Yes, we can handle both authentication methods seamlessly: typescript CopyInsert interface User {
4.   id: string;
5.   firstName: string;
6.   lastName: string;
7.   email: string;
8.   password?: string;        // Optional for Google users
9.   country: string;
10.   authProvider: 'email' | 'google';
11.   googleId?: string;        // For Google users
12.   emailVerified: boolean;   // Auto true for Google
13. }    
14. Google Authentication Requirements: We need:
    * Google Cloud Project
    * OAuth 2.0 Client credentials:
        * Client ID
        * Client Secret
    * Authorized domains
    * Redirect URIs
15. I can guide you through setting these up in the Google Cloud Console.
16. Handling Google Sign-up Information: We have two approaches: A. Two-Step Registration: typescript CopyInsert // Step 1: Google Auth
17. interface GoogleAuthResponse {
18.   email: string;
19.   firstName: string;
20.   lastName: string;
21.   googleId: string;
22. }
23. 
24. // Step 2: Additional Info Form
25. interface AdditionalInfoForm {
26.   country: string;         // Required
27.   occupation?: string;     // Optional
28. }     B. Post-Registration Profile Completion:
    * Let users in immediately after Google sign-in
    * Show a profile completion banner/modal
    * Restrict certain features until profile is complete
Questions for you:
1. Which approach do you prefer for collecting additional info from Google users?
    * Two-step registration (collect all info before access)
    * Post-registration completion (allow access, remind to complete)
2. Do you want to:
    * Allow users to switch between email/Google authentication?
    * Link multiple auth methods to one account?
3. For the profile picture:
    * Use Google profile picture by default?
    * Allow users to change it later?
    * Store a local copy or reference Google's URL?
Let me know your preferences on these points and any other questions you have!


    Which approach do you prefer for collecting additional info from Google users?

answer: i think showing a popup nice UI to request the users who signued up with their gmail for the first time fill First Name - Last Name - Country what do you think? this popup can appear after redirect them to the homepage after successfull authentication 

Do you want to:
Allow users to switch between email/Google authentication?
Link multiple auth methods to one account?
answer: no let's not complicate this 

For the profile picture:
Use Google profile picture by default?
Allow users to change it later?
Store a local copy or reference Google's URL?

no fetching profile from gmail, instead we give default profil pic for each user which is this one @default_profile.jpg 
also we allow users to upload their profile picture but with reasnable regulation in terms of formats, size, and dimensions  also giving the ready to choose profile pictures from this folder /public/profile_avatars
we show it in nice UX UI 


Two important points and two questions before we start

the google client secret codes and stuff you can find it here: @client_secret_62885177609-06lqatbcasjq43rmnp3d5uuerac31l0p.apps.googleusercontent.com.json 
for email OTP verification use resend.com which i already put the API in .env file 

for  the UI of all pages please follow strictly the same styling and Shadcn components we used ensure that we provide the best UI for all pages the similar to best professional websites are designign their login / signup and all other pages nowadays like resennd.com vercel and other great website similar to our project


now my questions are:
after user logged in caching and redirection should be smooth and fast, sending user to homepage directly without the need to make him log in again and consider his account is "remember me" activated if you know what i mean

the navbar if you run deep analysis you will see we have sign in / signup button 
after user logged in what would be the best approach to no longer show these two buttons and instead we show a dropdown menu from shadcn compnents that includes Profile picture - Full Name fetch from database - Arrow 
and when user clicks on this dropdown in the navbar (the one replaced the sign in sign up buttons) they will see My account - My Prompts (which is the bookmarked page) - Settings - log out 


PLEASE consider one important note to include in your plan and consider when you work with the database 
if you need to create or update anything in the database , please make sure you create a seperate seed file so you don't remove or overwrite the content we uploaded to the databaes like categories and prompts ..etc 


give me your final plan accordingly so i give you the approval 
make sure you well organized it and think it professionally and systemcaticaly as we agreed 

I'll revise the plan based on your requirements. Let me first check the Google credentials and current navbar implementation:

No credits consumed on this tool call.

Here's the revised implementation plan:
Phase 1: Database & Authentication Setup
1. Database Migrations (New File: prisma/migrations/auth_setup_20250225/)

prisma
CopyInsert
// Add to existing User model
model User {
  // Existing fields remain unchanged
  profileImageUrl String?
  emailVerified  Boolean   @default(false)
  googleId       String?   @unique
  lastLoginAt    DateTime?
}
2. Authentication Components (Following Resend/Vercel Style)

typescript
CopyInsert
src/components/auth/
├── sign-in/
│   ├── sign-in-form.tsx        // Clean, modern form with email/password
│   ├── google-button.tsx       // Styled Google OAuth button
│   └── auth-card.tsx          // Shadcn card component wrapper
├── sign-up/
│   ├── sign-up-form.tsx       // Matching style with sign-in
│   └── additional-info-modal.tsx // For Google users
└── shared/
    ├── auth-header.tsx        // Logo + form title
    └── auth-layout.tsx        // Centered layout with background
Phase 2: Session & State Management
1. Next-Auth Setup with Persistent Sessions

typescript
CopyInsert
// src/lib/auth/auth-options.ts
export const authOptions = {
  session: {
    strategy: 'jwt',
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
  },
  callbacks: {
    jwt: async ({ token, user }) => {
      // Persist user data in token
      return token
    },
    session: async ({ session, token }) => {
      // Enhance session with user data
      return session
    }
  }
}
2. Navbar User Menu (Following Shadcn)

typescript
CopyInsert
// src/components/layout/navbar/user-menu.tsx
export const UserMenu = () => {
  return (
    <DropdownMenu>
      <DropdownMenuTrigger>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Avatar>
            <AvatarImage src={user.profileImageUrl || '/profile_avatars/default_profile.jpg'} />
            <AvatarFallback>{initials}</AvatarFallback>
          </Avatar>
          <span>{user.firstName} {user.lastName}</span>
          <ChevronDownIcon />
        </div>
      </DropdownMenuTrigger>
      <DropdownMenuContent>
        <DropdownMenuItem>My Account</DropdownMenuItem>
        <DropdownMenuItem>My Prompts</DropdownMenuItem>
        <DropdownMenuItem>Settings</DropdownMenuItem>
        <DropdownMenuSeparator />
        <DropdownMenuItem>Log Out</DropdownMenuItem>
      </DropdownMenuContent>
    </DropdownMenu>
  )
}
Phase 3: Profile Management
1. Profile Picture Management

typescript
CopyInsert
// src/components/user/profile/avatar-selector.tsx
export const AvatarSelector = () => {
  return (
    <Dialog>
      <DialogTrigger>
        <Avatar className="h-24 w-24" />
      </DialogTrigger>
      <DialogContent>
        <Tabs>
          <TabsList>
            <TabsTrigger value="upload">Upload Photo</TabsTrigger>
            <TabsTrigger value="preset">Choose Avatar</TabsTrigger>
          </TabsList>
          <TabsContent value="upload">
            <ImageUpload 
              maxSize={2 * 1024 * 1024} // 2MB
              acceptedTypes={['image/jpeg', 'image/png']}
              aspectRatio={1}
            />
          </TabsContent>
          <TabsContent value="preset">
            <PresetAvatars path="/profile_avatars" />
          </TabsContent>
        </Tabs>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
